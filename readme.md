FrontEnd Projects: Practical projects to master applicable skills.
===

Frontend & Node.js micro-project ideas that challenge specific skills.

Each project should meet the following criteria:

1) Focus on a small collection of features that will almost certainly be
found on a quality, production web application.
2) Identify two or three skills targeted in the challenge
3) Refrence any prerequisites or skills needed to complete the challenge
and learn the targeted skills
4) All prerequisites must be attainable through projects listed as a
project in this repo. If it doesn't exist, then make it. 
5) Relevant, free materials & resources should be listed with each
project.
