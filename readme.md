FrontEnd Projects: Practical projects to master applicable skills.
===

Frontend & Node.js micro-project ideas that challenge specific skills.

Each project should meet the following criteria:

1. Focus on a small collection of features that will almost certainly be
required in a quality, production web application.
2. Identify two or three skills targeted in the challenge
3. Refrence any prerequisites or skills needed to complete the challenge
and learn the targeted skills
4. All prerequisites must be attainable through projects listed as a
project in this repo. If it doesn't exist, then make it. 
5. Relevant, free materials & resources should be listed with each
project.

# Draft Project Outline:
(These are not yet ordered or linked together according to the above
standards. )
- HTML5 Form that saves progress to locaal storage as the user fills it
  out. Bonus: Post data to NoSQL database when the user submits the
form.
- Find a javascript (or jQuery) pluggin that doesn't have tests. Fork
  the repo and write tests with Jasmine. Bonus: Send a pull request to
the source repo once a few tests are complete.
- Style a custom Google Map with Google Maps API. Examples at
  snazzymaps.com
- Build a readable, responsive blog post. Focus on redability and
  responsive content. Bonus: Determine best practice for responsive
images and include a featured image.
- Find an API at http://www.programmableweb.com/ and use AJAX to display
  content in your own archive. Bonus: Use a templating language like
handle bars to display data
- Refactor a jQuey plugin to eliminate the jQuery depenency.
- Use Google Maps API and HTML5 Geo Location to show a client's current
  location. Bonus: Use web sockets to track and update the map in real
time.

# Todo:
- Create project templates according to archive values.
